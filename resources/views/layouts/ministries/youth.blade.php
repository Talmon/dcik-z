                    3rd floor (topmost floor). Karibu ! Colossians 1:17 - He is before all things, and in Him all things

                      <p class="lead">The purpose of this ministry is as revealed through Jesus Christ in the New Testament:
                        <ul>
                          <li>To mobilize men to proclaim faith in Jesus Christ as the Son of the Living God, as Lord and Savior
                          </li>
                          <li>To commit men to active engagement in the Church
                          </li>
                          <li>To help men grow in grace and knowledge of Christ so they may increasingly know and do His will
                          </li>
                          <li>To work for unity of all Christians and with them engage in the common task of building the Kingdom
                            of God
                          </li>
                          <li>To establish stable Christian marriages and families within the body of Christ.
                          </li>

                        </ul>

                        In particular we shall endeavor to fulfill the following:
                        <ul>
                          <li>Bring men into a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.
                          </li>
                          <li>Unite men in Bible study, prayer, worship, ministry, fellowship, and accountability.
                          </li>
                          <li>Use men to create a supportive environment that touches the lives of the entire church family.
                          </li>
                          <li>Promote mentoring opportunities that lead to significant vital relationships.
                          </li>
                          <li>To become a magnet for service and a resource for other church ministries and missions.
                          </li>
                          <li>Mobilize men to support church programs
                          </li>
                          <li>Provide a series of events that will promote fellowship, outreach, and evangelism.</p>
