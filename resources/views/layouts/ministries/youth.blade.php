                    Deservio is a Latin word that means to serve zealously. Deservio® is a 6 months teens training and empowering program that prepares them for the future life in college and workplace.

                    Our Mission
                    To inspire and prepare teens to reach their full potential as productive, responsible and caring citizens.
                    The after-school hours are the most threatening time for young people, especially those who walk in our most economically challenged neighborhoods ravaged by violence and drugs. Yet, even in these troubled communities, our doors and our arms are open wide to give young people:

                    A safe place to learn and grow…
                    Ongoing relationships with caring, adult professionals…
                    Life-enhancing programs and character development experiences…
                    Hope and opportunity.
                  </p>

                  <p class="lead">
                    Deservio® offers a comprehensive and well-rounded lineup of structured and tested after school program for teens. Each of our programs is fun for young people while addressing today’s most pressing teen issues.
